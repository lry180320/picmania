# README

Picmania is a simple web app that allows you to publish your photos/pictures on Internet and further control them.

It was developed by [Leonid Rudy](http://www.flexdoc.xyz) using Ruby on Rails 6 to show how that technology can be learnt just in two weeks (at that, mostly by weekends and in other spare time).

The working app itself can be found here: [https://lry-picmania.herokuapp.com/](https://lry-picmania.herokuapp.com)

As it's hosted on a free Heroku account, it may take a while to start.
